As a full-stack developer and lifelong learner, I'm passionate about creating a positive impact. I take on projects to solve real-life challenges and streamline tasks. Currently in my spare time, I'm exploring Computer Vision and Machine Learning, with a keen interest in autonomous vehicles.

Beyond coding, I see myself as a problem-solver and innovative thinker. Continuous growth and curiosity drive me to make a meaningful difference in our world.

I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded teams who share my vision for innovation. Let's work together to shape a better tomorrow for everyone!
